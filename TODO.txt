FONT Issue only happens in google chrome 22-36. It doesn't like .woff files. My fix includes loading the fonts locally versus cdn. Changing the fonts.css to be SVG first, then WOFF, then legacy.

index.html
---------
NPR = network path references NPR (RFC 3986) "//url/" vs. "http://" Doesn't work in IE8 and earlier
HTML5 is not supported in anything less than ie9

line 16: NPR
23: NPR CDN reference to jquery lib. 
	Maybe: !if IE8 <= jquery 2.1
24: Why defer called? 
30: NPR
34: Combine with line 30, 
	if lt ie9 the NPR will not load right.
FIXED 83: Fix absolute refrence to logo.
FIXED 93: Fix absolute reference to search button

139 - 141: compile scripts. 
	Fix loading order. scripts.js should load last to prevent dependancy errors (scripts has onready it will have lines like $(obj).createdependancy(); )
145: combine inpage script into scripts.js -> already in scripts.js.

scripts.js
----------
Fix naming formality to be either $(obj) or jQuery(obj). 
combine onready and on load events.

main.css
----------
FIXED fix path dependancy: #global-menu-toggle {position:absolute; right:0; text-align:center; top:15px;  cursor:pointer;  font-size:22px;  text-transform:lowercase; background:url(/webdev/t4-templates/HTML/images/cwru-links-list.png)
Consider dropping the link for the font inside main.css. 


images
---------
Sprite sheet icon images 


WARNINGS
100% of flexslider.css is not being used.
84% of main.css is not being used. 

Requests: 
- Icons on the menu nav. Similiar to the style guide?
- cwru links on lose focus to close the menu.. This is fixed in the t4 as i wrote that up. I'll investigate with katie.
- On two column child page layout.. If a menu is on the left see if you can get it to stick like the menu. I think this might be a tall order because the menu will have to jump from a float left to a fixed position on the screen
